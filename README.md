# Networks Programming Assignment 3

We have included two directories: one with the source code for the client and the Makefile to make the client
and one for the server and the Makefile to make the server. Simply type make to compile the server and client 
when you are in their respective directories. 

To run the client:
./myftp <hostname>  <port_number>

For example:
./myftp student00.cse.nd.edu 41039

To run the server:
./myftpd <port_number>

For example:
./myftpd 41039
