Welcom to the message board repo!

We have included two directories: one with the source code for a client and the Makefile to make the client
and one for the server and the Makefile to make the server. Simply type make to compile the server and client 
when you are in their respective directories. 

To run the client:
./myfrm <hostname> <port_number>

For example:
./myfrm student00.cse.nd.edu 41039

To run the server:
./myfrmd <port_number> <admin_pswd>

For example:
./myfrmd 41039 admin

You will be prompted for more information as you run the program, such as what operation you would like 
to carry out (just enter the three letter operation in caps). You may also be prompted for info such as 
board name, etc.
